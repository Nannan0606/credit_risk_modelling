## Summary
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict loan defaults and their probability. 

We analyzed and pre-processed the data, trained and evaluated 3 models, namley KNN, logistic regression and XGBoost, for their ability to predict loan defaults and their probability. Precision, Recall, F1 score and accuracy were used to evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance. XGBoost performed the best on all metrics. We used feature importance to find the top 3 features that are most important to our predictions.
